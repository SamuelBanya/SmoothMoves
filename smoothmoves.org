* Title
<2022-09-19 Mon 19:55>: After a bit of deliberation last night, I stumbled upon a decent name for this project, which would include the following:
- Smooth Moves

Reason being is that we used a similarly named moving company recently, and funnily enough, it was not as smooth as we expected so I aim to correct that with this app's experience.

* Ideas
<2022-09-19 Mon 19:56>: These are mentioned in the 'README.md' already for this project, but this is much more inclusive and thought out than my Phase 2 project so I'm already pretty stoked for where this is going as I would have loved to have this kind of app before I moved recently.

* Design Ideas
<2022-09-19 Mon 19:57>: This will include the following design choices:
- Usage of React based forms for the frontend
- "Material UI" will be used as the CSS stylesheet framework

* How I Installed The Backend Components
<2022-09-19 Mon 20:13>: I first used the following command to install the Gem components:
#+begin_src bash
bundle install
#+end_src

* How I Created The Separate Frontend
<2022-09-19 Mon 20:16>: As instructed by the assignment, I created a separate repo folder for the React frontend component:
- https://github.com/SamuelBanya/SmoothMoves-Frontend

I then changed into this directory, and then used the following terminal command:
#+begin_src bash
npx create-react-app smoothmoves-frontend
#+end_src

Related output:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject

* How I Created The Related Migrations For The Related Tables
<2022-09-19 Mon 20:32>: I used the following migration command in terminal to create the necessary migration necessary for the 'User' table:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/SmoothMoves $ bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_users_table
db/migrate/20220920013221_create_users_table.rb
#+end_src

I then filled the contents of the 'db/migrate/20220920013221_create_users_table.rb' file with the following:
#+begin_src ruby
class CreateUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :pickup_location
      t.string :dropoff_location
    end
  end
end
#+end_src

I then ran the related migration with the following 'bundle exec rake db:migrate' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/SmoothMoves $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
== 20220920013221 CreateUsersTable: migrating =================================
-- create_table(:users)
   -> 0.0012s
== 20220920013221 CreateUsersTable: migrated (0.0013s) ========================
#+end_src

<2022-09-20 Tue 19:28>: I then created another migration for the 'items' table with the following 'bundle exec rake db:create_migration' command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/SmoothMoves $ bundle exec rake db:create_migration NAME=create_items_table
db/migrate/20220921003339_create_items_table.rb
#+end_src

I then entered the following inside the 'db/migrate/20220921003339_create_items_table.rb' file:
#+begin_src ruby
class CreateItemsTable < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :items do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :owner
      t.integer :length
      t.integer :width
      t.integer :height
      t.integer :weight
      # Values include "loose" or "boxed"
      t.string :item_type
    end
  end
end
#+end_src

I then ran the related migration for the 'bundle exec rake db:migrate' table with the following command:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/SmoothMoves $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
== 20220921003339 CreateItemsTable: migrating =================================
-- create_table(:items)
   -> 0.0013s
== 20220921003339 CreateItemsTable: migrated (0.0013s) ========================
#+end_src
